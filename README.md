# Lander_Lab_Modelling

This repository stores all files related with my modelling work during the lab rotation at Arthur Lander lab at UCI (April 2018-June 2018). The key python files are:

ksTest_2_SampLoop.py: The most important one! looping through different n and p, generating the best parameter pairs and the 2 graphs as well as 2 .csv files in the folder.
DataExtract.py: Extracting the observed nevi radius data, written by Rolando.
nStepSimRadius.py: A single simulation generating the distribution of nevi radius.
ksTest_2_Samp.py: Generating the Cumulative Distribution Curves of both real data and simulated data.
